Vimeo -> Video editing
Freepik -> Vector (SVG) assets

# UI vs UX
## UI
- Design itself

## UX 
- How the user uses the application
- how complicated it is to use
# 3D Printing
- Format: STL



# Video production process
Story -> Script -> Story board (Graph) -> Filming -> Video editing 
- Keep in mind [[Audience Analysis Factors|Audience]] you're targetting

## Storytelling
- Start with “What if”
- Protagonist and side characters (CASUALS)
- What the protagonist wants/needs (may be different)
- Obstacle
## Different ways
-  Pixar
	- Once upon a time … -> Because -> until finally


-  Marvel
	- Introduction to environment (World building)
## Script writing
- In order to film a story --> must have a script
- The dialogue the characters will say throughout the events of the story 
- Refer to George Bernard Shaw script writing style

## Storyboard
- Good when you can write a script just by looking at the images.
- Minimum 6 
- Simple illustrations
