# Audience analysis factors

## Expectations

- Should always pick the right time to speak about a certain topic
## Knowledge of topic
- How much the audience knows about a topic
- Research what the audience knows
- Remind of key terms without patronising 
## Attitude towards topic
- Don’t say controversial things
- Know how audience feels about topic
- Determine how much effort needed to convince
## Size
- Size **does** matter
- Large audience –> microphone + high ground
- Larger –> More formal
- Common language –> with small audience
- Formal –> Big crowd
## Demographics

	2. Gender
	3. Religion

  1. Size
  2. How audience is arranged –> Roman theatre example
- Time of day –> Speech at midnight HAHA NO
- Temperature –> won’t listen if freezing/sweating
- External noise –> can’t hear anything LOL
- Internal noise –> who brought their baby to this?
- Type of space –> school? church? outside?
- Gotta prepare for all that
  - Do I need to scream?
  - How will my body language be (where audience at)
  - What order are speakers?
## Voluntariness
- Did the audience go willingly? ~~or were they kidnapped~~
  - Cinema audience –> wants to be there they paid a ticket
  - Students –> most don’t want to be here LOL (try harder to keep them interested)
## Ego-centrism
- People only care about themselves
- Will this topic affect them directly? No? Don’t care.
- Make it seem important to them so they listen
