# Linear Model
- Sender Transmits Message –> Through Mass Media Channel –>To Receivers (Audience)
- Gatekeepers (news editors -> [[News Editing and Blogging]]) act as filters to what actually gets sent to who [[Audience Research and Analysis#Targeted Media vs Not Targeted|Targeting audience]]
- Allows for feedback: 
  1. Audience commenting/sending emails (letter to the editor etc)
  2. Phone calls
  3. Web posts
  4. Talk shows
- Problem: The message does not reach the audience smoothly -> [[Digital Mass Communication#Noise in communication"|Noise]]
- No control over how the message is decoded or understood
- Feedback in the end
## Shannon & Weaver 
   - Old school telephones (not analogue)
   - Noise in communication

|Pros                                   | Cons                                              |
|:--------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
|Noise concept helps                    | Feedback less important                           |
|Two way process, applicable in general | Misleading representation of communication        |
|                                       | Has difficult being applied to human communication|

## Laswell communication model
- 5 Components
   1. Who 
   2. says what?
   3. To whom?
   4. Which channel?
   5. With what effect?
- Can have delayed feedback

## Berlo 
   - Message -> most important part of communication process
   - Teacher and Students
   - SMCR
	 - Source --> Encodes Message --> Through Channel --> To Receiver

|Pros                                      |Cons                                |
|:-----------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
|Message and medium aligned with recipient | Lack of feedback                   |
|All factors considered                    | No barriers/noise mentioned        |
|Still used in purer forms of communication| Complex                            |
|Forms basis for higher models             | Linear                             |
|                                          | requires people to be on same level|
|                                          | omits thinking/analysing           |

# Cultural Model
- Individuals bring meanings to message
- Different people decode messages differently based on
  1. Gender
  2. Age
  3. Education
  4. Occupation
- Showcases complexity of how Senders lack control over how people react 
- Consumers shape media to fit or support their views –> **Selective Exposure**
- People with specific political opinions tend to seek posts that further support their preexisting views –> Confirmation bias



# Transaction model
- Two way model with real time feedback
- Example: Messages/Face to Face communication
- Public queues --> general look/first impression
- Private queues --> my own thoughts 
- Behaviour queues --> determine person by their acts/patterns
- Multi-layered feedback
- Complex model
- *Table for pros/cons*
## Barnlund
   - Focuses on noise
   - Credibility 
   - Encode/Decode
   - Sending/Feedback
   ![[Pasted image 20221105130747.png]]
   
|Pros      | Cons     |
|:-----|:-----|
| Shows shared field experience between sender and receiver | VERY complex     |
| Talks about simultaneous sending,noise and feedback       | Sender and receiver must understand code sent by one another (a code book)     |
| Most systematic model of communication                    |                    |

# Interaction models
- Two way without direct feedback
- Feedback from 3rd party --> Analysts 
## Schramm 
- Encode --> Interpreter --> Decoder
- Synchronous --> Always on 
- Feedback afterwards --> Very delayed
- Communication is circular
- Equal and reciprocal –> Both parties equally engaged
- Requires interpretation –> information need to be properly interpreted to be understood
- 3 steps:
