# Latex things
- Surround mathematical expressions with `$$`
- `$\bar{}$` is pog, example: $\bar{x}$
- `$<something>_{}$`  gives subscript ($X_{x}$)
- `$\frac{}{}` shows a fraction, example: $\frac{numerator}{denumerator}$
- Use `$\pm$` for $\pm$ and `$\mp$` for $\mp$
- For square roots use `$\sqrt{}$` as $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
- To indicate a prime just use `$^{\prime}$` as $x^{\prime}$ (Fight me about notations i dare you, fuken newtonian notations smh)
- You can also have a multitude of arrows as:
	- `$\leftarrow$` for $\leftarrow$ and it's thicker sibling `$\Leftarrow` for $\Leftarrow$
	- `$\rightarrow$` for $\rightarrow$ and the thicker sibling `$\Rightarrow` for $\Rightarrow$
	- `$\uparrow$` for $\uparrow$ and `$\Uparrow$` for $\Uparrow$
	- `$\downarrow$` for $\downarrow$ and `$\Downarrow$` for $\Downarrow$
- To represent infinity just write `$\infty$` $\infty$
- To write an integral write `$\int$` to give $\int$, to add the bound write `$int_{x_1}^{x_2}$` to give $\int_{x_1}^{x_2}$
- For sum: `$\sum_{n = i}^{\infty}$` to give $\sum_{n = i}^{\infty}$ and product: `$\prod_{i = a}^{b}$` to give $\prod_{i = a}^{b}$
- Should you be fancy and want to work with limits: `$\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)$` to give $\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)$
