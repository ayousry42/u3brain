# What is Brain? 
This started as my personal notes for college in [Obsidian](https://obisidian.md) then things took off, people saw them and few others started contributing to them. What was once one "brain" became a shared brain, while I still maintain my own personal "vault" I do want to have a public "version" where others can benefit and even contribute their own notes and information so everyone benefits :D


# How do I use this? 
1. Obviously you need to download [obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
2. clone this repo or download the zip
3. (if you cloned skip this) extract the archive
4. Launch obsidian and click "open vault" or something similar
5. Select the folder "Brain" that you extracted/cloned


# Basic obsidian tips
1. Ctrl+G is the "graph view"
2. Ctrl+O opens any files you wanna look for
3. Ctrl+E toggles reading/editing view
4. If you only intend to use this for reading (which is fine!) 
  Open settings > Editor > Default view for tabs and set that to reading view

# Contributing
I do have a few strict rules when it comes to contributing to keep things consistent 

1. Follow formatting present in the other files
2. Anything math related should be represented properly (USE [LATEX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn))
3. Keep things brief
4. Link to existing files when needed (we don't want redundant info!)
5. Follow file hierarchy
6. Contact contributers if any info is missing
7. Cite sources when possible for further research!
8. Use the provided templates (will update those frequently hopefully)
