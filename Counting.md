# Counting
>- Count number of elements in sets
>- Union is + of all Sets - Intersection of all sets
>- Power set raise 2 to power of n (number of elements)
>- Product multiply it lol
>## Count loops
>>- (m - n) /x + 1
>> 	m is end
>> 	n is start 
>> 	x is step
>> 	+1 is at end of EVERYTHING
>>- Nested loops you multiply 
>## Complexity
>>- Number of steps in operation
>>- Neglect constants
>>- log n is best
>>- Linear is *okay*
>>- 1 is constant
>>- powers bad
>>- exponential VERY BAD (AI Moment)
>>- always take highest power when calculating
>>- calculate by taking limit tending to infinity 
>## Selection
>>- No constraints: n^r
>>- Permutation (ordered) nPr -> n!/(n-r)!
>>- Combination (unordered ex: sets) nCr -> nPr/r!
>## Computability
>>- Measure with finite automata
