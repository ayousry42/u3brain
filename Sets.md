#Discrete 
## Sets
- Principal for databases
- No duplications
- No order
>|A| = number of elements
>Power set -> Set of all possible subsets
>Order = Tuple = record in database 
>"A **x** B" -> Cartesian Product
>Union -> Everything in both
>Symmetric Difference -> Union without the intersection
----
## Multi-Sets
- Allow duplications
- Ordered pairs of (element,n) n -> times repeated in set
- Not very common or approved of
----
## Representing Sets
### 1. Curly Braces
>Pretty Standard
### 2. Matrix (For Products)
> AxB 
> Domain (A) is the column , CoDomain (B) is the row
> 	b1,b2,b3
> a1
> a2
> a3
### 3. Bit String (for subsets)
> Very Cool
> 1s and 0s
> U = {x1,x2,x3,x4}
> A subset of U = {x1,x4}
> A = 1001
