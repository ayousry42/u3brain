It's translated to:
Black -> 0
Brown ->1
Red -> 2
Orange -> 3
Yellow -> 4
Green -> 5
Blue -> 6
Purple -> 7
Gray -> 8
White -> 9

- The last color in resistor means the number of zeros
- If the color is Gold or Silver it means the tolerance of the resistor
- Gold -> 5%  Silver -> 10%
- Tolerance means it will be between : the no. + no. $\cdot$ percentage and  the no. - no. $\cdot$ percentage
