Conductor: Something conduct electricity (wire,etc.)
Insulator: Something that doesn't conduct electricity (plastic,rubber,etc.)
Semi conductor material: between conductor and insulator (depends on electrical signals) (ex: silicon)
## How semi-conductor works?
- All the electrons stored in Valence Band (Always been below)
- Band Gap is empty space between Valence Band and conduction band
- the more it heats up the more electron will goes up to conduction band
- ![[Pasted image 20230123014049.png]]
- N-type: has extra electrons about the energy level in the conduction band (Donor atom(Donates electrons to conduction band )) and valence band is still full because the electrons of conduction band comes from the donor.
- P-type: has holes(missing electrons) Accept one of the electrons from the valence band (steal the electron from valence band to impurity atoms and leaves holes behind V.B. ) C.B. is empty btw.
- The positive should go to p-type material and negative should go to n-type material.
- In diode the long leg terms to positive and short leg terms to negative
- Diode vs Voltage always been exponentially (if we put very high voltage it'll burn out)
- The diode should have resistor  (that have between 200-330 ohm resistor) so we can't burn out the led
- frequency = $\frac {1} {wave length}$ 
- Energy = Energy gap = h $\cdot$ f (h is constant)
- The high frequency has (purple , violet,U.V.).
- The low frequency has (red,infrare).
