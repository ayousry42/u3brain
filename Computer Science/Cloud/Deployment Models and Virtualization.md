# Types of Deployment Model cloud
 1.  Public Cloud: 
	 infrastructure is made avaliable to general public and large industry of group and is owned by OSCS(Orgnization selling cloud services) ex: Azure- Google
 2. Private: Infrastructure is operated solely for an orgnization
 3. Community: THe infrastrucutr is shared by several orgnization and supports a comunity that has shared concerns
 4. Hybrid: Compostion of two or more cloud as unique entites

### Public Cloud
Pros: 
1. Minimal invesment : No substantial fee
2. No setup cost
3. No Infrastrucutre Managment
4. No maintences
5. Dynamic Scability

### Private Cloud
pros:
1. Better Control
2. Data Security and privacy
3. Supports legacy system
4. Customizaition
### Community Cloud
Pros:
1. Cost Effective
2. Security
3. Shared Recourses
4. Collaboration and data sharing

### Hybrid Cloud
Pros:
1. Fexibility and control
2. Cost: only pay for extra capacity
3. Security


#### Virtualization
Is a Basic enabler for Cloud computing 
Is important:
1. Performance isolation
2. system security
3. Performance
4. Development


### hypervisor/VMM
Partitions the recources pf computer sustem into one or more virtual machines
Allows several OS to run concurrently (Makes you feel like they are parallel) on a single hardware platform
VM: us an execution enviroment that runs an OS
VMM allows to: 
1. multiple services to share same platform
2. Live migration
3. System modification
