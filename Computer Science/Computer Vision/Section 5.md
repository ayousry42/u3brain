#ComputerVision 
### Noise types:
1. Amplifer/Gaussian noise: Constant amplitude at each pixel (like sand noise)(It feels like enha mahzoza)
2. Salt and pepper noise: (Like you put salt pepper by adding white or black pixel choosen by random pixel) (Bright pixel in dark region and dark pixel in Bright region)
3. shot noise (Like flash light )
4. Spackle noise(Playing with grayscale Like: Our grandfather photo)

### Cross Correlation filter / Convolution Filter
Search about it can't write anythin lmao

Cross be like mirror : Your right is mirror's left

Convolution: Like doing normal filter.
