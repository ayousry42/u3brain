#Programming 

# Dynamic Binding
>  Everything is an Object
>  No really Object is the super class of ALL

# [[Constructor Chaining]]
# Overloading Vs Overriding
## Overloading
>  Same name different parameters
## Overriding
>  Same name in super and same parameters
>  different use in sub class
# Casting References
>  You can cast an object using a sub class' constructor
>  Can only use methods in super class
>  Methods can be overridden 
>  Cast the object to be able to use the sub class methods
>  Can only cast down the tree not sideways
>  Arrays of superclasses can store subtypes as elements
