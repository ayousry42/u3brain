# Search methods in Graphs

#Discrete 
# See ->[[Graphs]]
## Weighted
### Dijkstra Algorithm:
> Steps to do the thing:
> 1. Draw graph again
> 2. Create a table to determine cheapest path to each individual node
> 3. Start from end in table and go back

### Huffman Algorithm
>1. After drawing Huffman tree in [[Graphs]]  get code of element
>2. Get size of element (number of bits in code x number of elements) 
### Shortest Path
### Travelling Salesman search
### Shortest Salesman search
----
## Unweighted
> Specific methods
> Reach same point with less cost
> Discard more expensive paths
### BFS
> Breadth search
> Goes level by level
### DFS
> Depth search
> Goes path by path
> left, up, right
### Binary Tree search
> 1s and 0s for whether value is larger
> Left if larger
> Right if smaller
