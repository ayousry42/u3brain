# DES
> Symmetric Encryption -> Same key
> 64 bit key but in reality its 56 bit because 8th bit is ignored (Dumb)
> Block Encryption -> Split message into equal size blocks and encrypt
> Stream Ciphers -> not equal sizes just constantly getting data
## How it works 
>Turn key to bits  -> Create subkeys
>Turn plain text to bits and split in half -> Apply algorithm
## Why it sucks
>4-5 Days to  brute force
>Small key size
## How to improve 
> BIGGER Key
> Triple DES time
