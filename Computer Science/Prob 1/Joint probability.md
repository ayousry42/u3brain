#Probability 
# Join probability
>### Definition
>- Studying multiple experiments at once
>- Multiple [[Random variables]]
>### PDF
>- fxy
>- Has same properties as normal PDF
>- Marginals have to be equal 1 (Regular PDFs of each variable alone)
>- f(y) = Summation f(x,y) in terms of all values of x
>
>### Indepedent random variables
>if f(x,y) = f(x).f(y) for all values of x,y
>
>### Conditional Joint probability
>Rule = Joint/Marginal of given (after the / in f(x/y))
>
>### Mean
>- Constants be  negative 
>- E(x-y) = E(x) - E(y)
>
>### Variance
>- Constants always positive (squaring moment)
>- V(x-y) = V(x) + V(y)
