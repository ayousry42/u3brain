#Probability 
## Moment Generating Function
### Definition
> The mean of random variable is refferred to as first moment of prob distribution
> In general rth moment is E(x^r)
> Derive MGF to get E(x^r) r amount of times

#### General Steps to do the thing
>1. Âµx(t) = E(e^xt)
>2. Get function form of Mx(t) using series simplification
>3. Derive n amount of times to get nth moment -> E(x^n)
### Used to calculate E(x) using differentiation instead of sigma and integrations
>Mx(t) = E(e^tx)
>E(x^r) = dr/dt Mx(t) where t = 0 <- rth moment
>apply Maclaurin to Mx(t) = E(e^xt)
>1+t(E(x)) + t^2/2! . E(X^2)......
>derive with respect to t , t gets yeeted and put t = 0, only the rth t doesn't have a t and the rest are 0s so its E(x^r)

### Usage in [[Special Discrete probablity distributions]]
#### Binomials
>Mx(t) = E(e^tx)
>Summation of e^xt . f(x)
>f(x) = nCx . p^x . q^n-x
>Summation x to n of (nCx . (e^tp)^x q^(n-x)) <- this is binomial
>Mx(t) = (pe^t + q)^n <- Whole function

#### Geometric
> refer to Geometric sequence f(x) etc
