## Conditional Probability
### Multiplication Rule
- P(A/B) = P(A && B)/P(B)
- P(B/A) = P(A&&B) / P(A)
- P(A && B) = P(A/B) . P(B) = P(B/A) . P(A)![[Pasted image 20220329094650.png]]
### Independent Events
- When P(B/A) = P(B)
- P(A/B) = P(A)
- P(A && B ) = P(A) . P(B)

#### Circuit problems
- Series Circuit -> Multiply probabilities (Intersections) 
- Parralel Circuit -> 1 - Union of all Compliment = 1 - Multiply of probabilities compliment
