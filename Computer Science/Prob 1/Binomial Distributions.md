## 2. Binomials
> n Bernoulli trials
> trials **independent**
> Probability of success is **constant**
> x = {0,1,2,3....n} 
> f(x) = nCx . p^x . q^n-x -> Literally binomial theorem from Senior 3
> E(x) = np
> V(x) = npq = variation^2
> E(X) and E(X') where X and X' are opposite events -> E(x) = n - E(x')
