### Population Vs Sample
Population: 
1. Is parameter 
2. Is set of all elements under investigation
3. It's hard to define
4. Hard to observe
5. hard to contact


Sample:
1. Is statistics
2. Is a subset of population 
3. Is much easier
4. less time
5. less cost

Population has:
Population Mean: μ
Population Variance: σ<sup>2</sup> 
Population St. dev: σ

While sample has: 
Sample Mean: x̄ = Σ x<sub>i</sub> / n 
where n is sample size
Sample Variance: S<sup>2</sup> = (Σ(x<sub>i</sub>-x̄)<sup>2</sup> ) / n-1

x̄ and S<sup>2</sup> are R.v
which means it has E(x̄) and V(x̄)\

E(x̄) = μ
V(x̄) = σ<sup>2</sup>/n

x̄ ~ Normal(μ,σ<sup>2</sup>/n)
But Standard Normal of x̄ is
Z -> (x̄ - μ) / (σ/√n)

sample size should be >= 30 (n>=30)
### Random sample
R.S should be:
1. Indpendent : Selection of x<sub>i</sub> doesn't effect x<sub>i+1</sub>
2. Identically dist: ![[Pasted image 20221022183611.png]]

In other word RS is a IID: which means Indpendent Identically dist
